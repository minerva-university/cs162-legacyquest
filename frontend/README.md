# About Legacy Quest's frontend

## The Vite + React Framework
There is no practical differences from using the "create-react-app" framework. Just a few things to pay attention to:

- Run `npm run dev` instead of `npm start` in the `frontend` folder to build the webpage
- `.js` files now have `.jsx` file extension by default. There is no differneces in coding, it's just an additional suffix thing.
- When there is an error in your JavaScript, sometimes the browser will show a blank page instead of explicitly showing the error. You can see the error in 'Developer tools -> Console'

## The Material UI Library
Materuial UI (MUI) is a React that implements the Material design by Google. It provides a lot of useful components (like Paper, Card, Box, Stack...) and provide a flexible way to style our webpage. You can still mix traditional HTML inside it, but I recommend trying it out because it will save you a lot of time.
